* #####[What is Github](http://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/)
*GitHub is Web Application (i.e. website) that provides cloud storage free for open source projects. It also provides a set of tools for coordinating work between different contributors.*
